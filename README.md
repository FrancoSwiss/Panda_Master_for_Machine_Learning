With business data, we often have numerical and categorical data. In my experience, those are the 8 major challenges I see:

(1) Missing numerical data.

(2) Imputation mean vs. median.

(3) Gaussian vs. skewed distribution.

(4) Missing categorical data at random (MCAR).

(5) Outlier Detection based on Tukey's IQR * 1.5.

(6) Cardinality and Rare Values.

(7) LabelEncoding and One-Hot Encoding.

(8) Normalization vs. Standardization.

I omit some more advanced, but rarer problems such as mixed categorical data and NaN's in the timestamp.
